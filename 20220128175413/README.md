# Hello world!

Welcome to my Zettelkasten! I think I got this shell script working to automate some of my note taking.

## What is a Zettelkasten?

This repository is where I will keep all of my notes. I do not ensure quality nor accuracy. The goal of the 
Zettelkasten isn't to make a central bank of high quality ideas that everyone should read; rather, they exist mostly
as storage for quick ideas. For quality ideas, a Zettel may one day become a blog post or some other form of writing
that I would ensure quality control over. Zettels will not be deleted nor modified (unless something such as a typo or
misquote would be harmful to leave as-is). The idea is to create new connections and enhance existing ones.

Ideally, a person would only have one Zettelkasten, and all Zettels would go into it. Though, I may have secrets that
may need to stay hidden; I'm not sure yet how I'll handle that. Also, I plan to host this repository on GitHub, and
GitHub has a limit of 1000 files shown in a directory at a time. For that purpose, I've split my Zettelkasten into
folders by year -- if a year has more than 1000 Zettels I'll be shocked.
