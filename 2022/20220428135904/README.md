# Time Off at Microsoft

As a Software Engineer (level 59) at Microsoft, I recieve the following
time off:

- Vacation Time: 15 days
- Holidays (federal): 10 days
- Personal Holidays: 2 days
- Paid sick days/mental health days: 10 days
- Maternity disability leave: 8 weeks
- Parental leave: 12 weeks
- Family caregiver leave: 4 weeks

Yes, at Microsoft, I actually qualify to officially use my sick days as
"mental health days" (and people do it all the time). Just woke up on
the wrong side of the bed, or you have a lot of anxiety from a ton of
built up errands you have to do? MHD. I absolutely love this; I wouldn't
want to have to come into work (or lie about how I feel) in order to get
a day off if my pet dies.
