# Designing a Solution

Things to think about when designing a solution:

1. Do I deeply understand the business problem and requirements?
1. What are the constraints/bottlenecks that I may face?
1. How much can I vertically slice the problem?
1. What design patterns should I evaluate?
1. Can I leverage an existing solution?
1. Have I adequately prepared my local environment for
   design, implementation, and testing?
1. What should be documented and refactored for readability?
