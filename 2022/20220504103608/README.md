# How to Deal With Conflict in the Workplace

Notes from [NPR's Life Kit
episode](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/07/1091455113/how-to-handle-conflict-at-work).

- Talk about behaviors, not personality. It invites a response that is
  more reasonable.
- Be specific, provide evidence.
- Handle things right away rather than over months with action plans.
- "When you give me a blank, I fill it with demons." Be specific and
  give observable facts.
- Actively listen to their side of the story to de-escalate. "Hear the
  sigh of relief."
- You are your best advocate; seek out trusted sources at work and lean
  on them.
