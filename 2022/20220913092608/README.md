# The Twelve-Factor App

While reading Cloud Native Patterns by Cornelia Davis, she mentioned
this website: [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/).

This is a fantastic website with a wealth of information. It leaves out
the "how-to" (probably overdone), and it hyper focuses on the
**"why"** which I appreciate.
