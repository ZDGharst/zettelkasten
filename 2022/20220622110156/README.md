# Cloud Native Patterns - Forward & Preface

[Cloud Native Patterns by Cornelia Davis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36410104-cloud-native-patterns)

- High performing teams have architectures that enable developers to
  quickly and independently develop, test, and deploy value to
  customers.
- The architecture that developers work within impacts the daily work
  more than anything.
- In an example from her career, she recognizes the formula and pattern
  for standard deviation, but struggled with when and why to apply it.
  - The context is far more important -- the when and why of applying
    these patterns.
- The vast majority of software today follows that complicated context:
  distributed systems.
- Code Examples are available on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/cdavisafc/cloudnative-abundantsunshine).
