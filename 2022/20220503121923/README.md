# Expand/Collapse Code Blocks

Visual Studio and VSCode have different hotkeys for expanding and collapsing code blocks.

## Visual Studio

Expand/collapse a single code block: ^m-m  
\*Collapse all code blocks: ^m-o  
\*Expand all code blocks: ^m-p  

\*Requires you to set "Collapse regions when collapsing to definitions" in preferences (^Q and search for "Collapse")

## VSCode

In VSCode, it's a bit more intuitive for hotkeys.

Expand: ^shift+[  
Collapse: ^shift+]  
Expand all: ^shift+alt+[  
Collapse all: ^shift+alt+]
