# Lack of zettel-ing

Soon after creating my zettels repo I had two events that happened:

1. My Windows drive crashed. As much as I love Ubuntu, it was too hard to do certain things that I really wanted to do 
League of Legends with Cori). I uninstalled Ubuntu so that I could install Windows on that drive, and then I never got 
around to setting up this repo again.
1. I started work at Microsoft (on 2/22/2022) and started writing zettels there on a private directory about work stuff.
Most of my mental effort were going to my new job, so I didn't have the patience/energy for this.

I always had intentions of writing more zettels, but the days slipped past me. Now that I have everything set back up,
I hope to start writing again soon as a form of emotional and mental outlet.
