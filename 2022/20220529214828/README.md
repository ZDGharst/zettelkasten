# Don't Get Mad, Get Busy

I love this quote. "Don't Get Mad, Get Busy". Upset about littering? Get
out there with a trash bag. A process at work is difficult and needs
some elbow grease to improve? Be that person to improve it. I think
a lot of people prefer to talk about what they are going to do rather
than just do it, and I'm no exception to that.
