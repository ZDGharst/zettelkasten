# Fun->Work, not Work->Fun

You want your fun projects to encroach on your work projects, not the other way
around. Explore that novel frontend framework, try out Rust even if you don't do
systems code, and make a game using a game engine even if you're just a backend
dev.

You will have plenty of experience doing what you need to do at work. What you
won't have is the ability to explore new things. You want those new things to
influence your work, too, because the next time someone has a need for a new web
service, you can say that you've done some stuff in Rust and you think Rust
could be very beneficial for this usecase for x, y, and z. I wrote x, y, and
z here, because I don't really know Rust, but wouldn't it be nice to at least be
able to say what x, y, and z are?
